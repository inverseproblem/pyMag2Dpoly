Overview
*************

**pyMag2DPoly** *is a Python package conceived for forward magnetic anomaly calculation due to two-dimensional polygonal bodies with uniform arbitrary polarization*. 

The formulations implemented in this package are that of Talwani & Heirtzler (1962, 1964), Won & Bevis (1987) and revised Kravchinsky et al. (2019).

If you use this code for research or else, please cite the related paper:

Alessandro Ghirotto, Andrea Zunino, Egidio Armadillo & Klaus Mosegaard (2020). **Magnetic Anomalies Caused by 2D Polygonal Structures with Uniform Arbitrary Polarization: new insights from analytical/numerical comparison among available algorithm formulations**. Submitted to Geophysical Research Letters.

The specific procedures for each formulation, the analytical/numerical results derived from their comparison and the rectification made to Kravchinsky et al. (2019) algorithm are describde in detail in the paper above.
