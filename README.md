# pyMag2Dpoly #

pyMag2Dpoly is a Python package conceived for forward magnetic anomaly calculation due to two-dimensional polygonal bodies with uniform arbitrary polarization. Docs: https://inverseproblem.github.io/pyMag2Dpoly

The formulations implemented in this package are that of Talwani & Heirtzler (1962, 1964), Won & Bevis (1987) and revised Kravchinsky et al. (2019). The specific procedures for each formulation, the analytical/numerical results derived from their comparison and the rectification made to Kravchinsky et al. (2019) algorithm are describde in detail in the paper below.
